🌐 Cynthia Ugwu Replica
✨ Overview

The Cynthia Ugwu Replica project is a modern, visually engaging, and highly interactive website built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform). It is inspired by the portfolio website of the renowned designer Cynthia Ugwu, known for her sleek minimalism and elegant motion design.

This project focuses on recreating the smooth animations, creative transitions, and responsive design of her site while maintaining performance and clean code practices. Every animation and layout detail has been carefully implemented to reflect a professional-level understanding of front-end development and animation logic.

💡 Project Purpose

The goal of this project was to challenge myself to replicate a high-end creative portfolio website without using frameworks or prebuilt animation libraries other than GSAP. I wanted to explore how animation and interaction can be used to tell a visual story, enhancing user engagement through motion and design.

By rebuilding this site from scratch, I strengthened my knowledge of DOM manipulation, scroll-based animations, and smooth transition effects, while learning how to manage animation performance for different screen sizes.

🧰 Technologies Used

HTML5: For clean and semantic structure.

CSS3: For layout styling, responsiveness, and transitions.

JavaScript (ES6): For dynamic functionality and animation triggers.

GSAP: For creating smooth, timeline-based animations and scroll-triggered effects.

🚀 Features

Fully responsive design that adapts across devices.

Smooth and elegant GSAP animations.

Interactive elements with hover and scroll effects.

Minimal, clean, and modern user interface.

🧠 What I Learned

This project taught me how to combine design precision with animation logic, how to optimize GSAP timelines for performance, and how small visual details make a big difference in user experience. It improved my confidence in writing clean front-end code and designing visually appealing, animation-rich websites.
